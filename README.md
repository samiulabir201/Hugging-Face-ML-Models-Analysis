This project aims to analyze the ease of use of machine learning (ML) applications in two specific domains: "Text Classification" and "Text Generation." The analysis is based on models available in the Hugging Face ML store. The primary focus is to determine whether "Text Classification" models are easier for software developers in terms of coding and maintenance efforts compared to "Text Generation" models.
